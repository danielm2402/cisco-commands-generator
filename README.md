# Cisco Commands Generator

_Generate the commands to configure your routers in cisco packet tracer_

## Motivation 🚀

_I recently did my computer networking course at my university, we used cisco packet tracer to simulate our networks, but we were not allowed to make configurations by the graphical environment (we could only configure through the command console of each router). This was a problem for me because it was somewhat slow remembering the commands, plus some things were repetitive (like setting up interfaces or passwords of the routers) and distracted me from the main problem. For this reason, while I was advancing in my course, I made a small program in JS to generate the repetitive commands to only have to copy and paste on each router, in this way I improved my times when configuring a topology and allowed me to focus on the real problem._

***Note:*** _This project is for the purpose of maximizing your productivity when making basic configurations, I clarify that it is not for the purpose of fraud in exams or practices._
